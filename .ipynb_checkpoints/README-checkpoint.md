## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

It would be beneficial to create a more user-friendly interface to locate a desired code, rather than just look through the entire list. It would also be interesting to figure out which effects were most common in the codes.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The Game Genie is a line of video game cheat cartridges originally designed by Codemasters and sold by Camerica and Galoob. This dataset is a list of Game Genie codes for the Nintendo Entertainment System. These codes were originally released by Galoob in official Game Genie Codebooks. These codebooks were transcribed by Ugetab on https://www.angelfire.com/nc/ugetab/Galoob_Codebooks.html. The codes contain both an address and a byte of code. When using the game genie, it tricks the NES into using the entered byte instead when accessing the address. Due to how the codes work, there are functionally infinite codes for every game. The ones listed in the document are just the ones known to have beneficial effects. The codes were discovered by randomly inputting codes until something came close to a desired result. Then, the code would be altered slightly until it had a beneficial, or humerous, effect. Consumers could send codes that they found to Galoob to be published in later issues of their code books.
